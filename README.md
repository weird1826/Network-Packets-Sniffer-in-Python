# PRODIGY_CS_05
## Network Packet Sniffer Tool in Python
- A python implementation for a network packet sniffer tool
- Detects and Analyzes packets of ICMP, IGMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS
- Displays source IP, destination IP and the payload in the packet
- Doesn't display the raw payload though (will work on it)
- NOTE: I don't know why but the program occasionally crashes out of nowhere when clicking the "Stop" button. Unfortunately, I could not find any help for it so if it ever happens to you, I'll suggest you to try running the program again :)
